    Tangle-Drive can be used to upload files to the 
    <a
      href="https://ipfs.io/"
      target="_blank"
    >
      IPFS
    </a>
     to share them securely.
  </p>
   
  <p>
    The content hash is stored in the 
    <a
      href="https://iota.org/"
      target="_blank"
    >
      IOTA Tangle
    </a>
    . You are able to access it by the bundle hash you receive after the upload.
  </p>
   
  <p>
    The 
    <a
      href="https://iota.org/"
      target="_blank"
    >
      Tangle
    </a>
     is an immutable storage. Therefore using this bundlehash, you can be 100% sure, that your file was not edited since the upload.

    We are using 0 value

     transactions. Thus your files will be deleted during the next Snapshot.
  </p>
   
  <p>
    Before this can happen, the 
    <a
      href="https://ipfs.io/"
      target="_blank"
    >
      IPFS
    </a>
     garbage collector will delete your files after aprox. 24 hours.
  </p>
   
  <p>
    We are already testing different solutions which will solve both problems.
  </p>
   
  <p>
    Also note that your files are not encrypted by Tangle-Drive. Anyone who has the bundle hash is able to download your files.
