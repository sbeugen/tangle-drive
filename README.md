For a detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).

## To Do

- Download all files directly. Curretly Tangle-Drive is redirecting you to ipfs.io/ipfs/[content hash] <span style="color:green">DONE</span>
- Fill AboutMe Page with content
- Set up IPFS node on server
- Save the content hash permanently in the Tangle. Either by adding a value of 1 IOTA to the transaction or using a permanode
